ask: 
> should we add a `good first issue` tag
> > this sounds like a good first issue for me. I would like to work on it with some help with you.
>  what level of "WIP" is this? it sounds like it just needs some clean up. was it only this one small thing left undone intentionally?





so should I make a file in [o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/)[^o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/]

named `MultiplayerSample PAK Builds (WIP)`

remove the notes from  [multiplayer-workflow-tests.md](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/multiplayer-workflow-tests.md#area-multiplayersample-pak-builds-wip)[^multiplayer-workflow-tests.md] 

and put the notes in the new file to be named `sig-network\testing-guidance\workflow-tests\multiplayer\MultiplayerSample PAK Builds (WIP)`

then in [multiplayer-workflow-tests.md](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/multiplayer-workflow-tests.md#area-multiplayersample-pak-builds-wip)[^multiplayer-workflow-tests.md]

remove [Area: MultiplayerSample PAK Builds (WIP)](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/multiplayer-workflow-tests.md#area-multiplayersample-pak-builds-wip)[^Area_Multiplayer_Sample_PAK_Builds_WIP]  and it notes

add a link to the new file I will make named `MultiplayerSample PAK Builds (WIP)` under [General Docs](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/multiplayer-workflow-tests.md#general-docs)[^General-Docs] in [multiplayer-workflow-tests.md](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/blob/main/testing-guidance/workflow-tests/multiplayer/multiplayer-workflow-tests.md)[^multiplayer-workflow-tests.md]?
